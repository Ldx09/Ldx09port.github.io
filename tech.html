					What is Cricket
				</header>
				<p>
Cricket is a sport that combines elements of strategy, skill, and athleticism. The game involves two main roles: batting and bowling. The team batting aims to score runs by hitting the ball and running between two sets of wickets, while the bowling and fielding team strives to dismiss the batsmen and restrict the scoring. Batsmen use a flat, elongated wooden bat to defend the wickets, and bowlers deliver the ball with the intention of hitting the stumps or inducing the batsman to make a mistake.
				</p>

<p> Cricket matches can span different formats, each with its own rules. Test matches are the longest format, lasting up to five days, with each team batting twice. One Day Internationals (ODIs) have a limited number of overs per innings (usually 50), making them shorter and more fast-paced. Twenty20 (T20) is the shortest format, with each team allowed only 20 overs per innings, resulting in high-scoring and entertaining matches.
 </p>

<p> Fielding positions in cricket are strategically placed, and captains use bowlers with diverse styles to exploit the weaknesses of the opposition. The sport has its unique terminology, including terms like "wickets," "runs," "boundaries," and "sixes," each contributing to the overall score. Cricket matches often have captivating moments, such as close catches, powerful sixes, and strategic bowling spells.

 </p>

<p> The pinnacle of international cricket is the ICC Cricket World Cup, held every four years, where teams from around the world compete for the prestigious title. Cricket has a massive fan following, especially in countries like India, Australia, England, Pakistan, and South Africa, where it is deeply ingrained in the culture. The sport has evolved over centuries, and its rich history, coupled with the spirit of fair play and competition, continues to captivate audiences globally.

        History of Cricket
    </header>
    <p>
        The tapestry of cricket's history begins in medieval England, where rudimentary bat-and-ball games laid the groundwork for what would become a global phenomenon. Emerging from the bucolic settings of rural England, cricket gradually evolved, finding favor among diverse communities. The 17th century marked a pivotal period when matches were not merely recreational but played for significant stakes. This era also saw a nascent attempt to formalize the sport, culminating in the creation of the "Articles of Agreement" in 1727â€”a crucial step towards standardizing cricket's rules and regulations. As the 18th century unfolded, county cricket took root, bringing structure and organized competition to the burgeoning sport and establishing Hambledon Cricket Club as a noteworthy center of cricketing culture. Here's a detailed overview of cricket's historical journey:
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Origins (16th Century):</h4>
        Cricket's roots can be traced back to 16th-century England, likely evolving from ball-and-bat games played by shepherds. The first documented references to cricket appear in historical records during this period.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Growth and Formalization (17th Century):</h4>
        Cricket gained popularity in the 17th century, with evidence of matches played for significant stakes. In 1727, the game took a formal step forward with the creation of the "Articles of Agreement," marking an early attempt to codify its rules.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Development of County Cricket (18th Century):</h4>
        The 18th century witnessed the establishment of county cricket in England. Matches between different counties became common, and Hambledon Cricket Club in Hampshire emerged as a prominent hub for the sport.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Introduction of Bowling Overarm and Formation of MCC (19th Century):</h4>
        During the 19th century, cricket underwent notable changes, including the transition from underarm to overarm bowling. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), founded in 1787, played a crucial role in codifying the Laws of Cricket, providing standardized rules for the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Birth of Test Cricket, Limited-Overs and T20 Formats (19th - 21st Century):</h4>
        The late 19th century saw the birth of Test cricket with the first match between England and Australia in 1877. The 20th century brought innovations like limited-overs cricket, with the first official One Day International held in 1971. In the 21st century, Twenty20 (T20) cricket gained prominence, leading to the establishment of global T20 leagues and further commercialization of the sport.

					Basic Rules of Cricket
				</header>
				<p> <h4>Objective:</h4>
The primary objective in cricket is for a team to score more runs than its opponent
					
				</p>
				<p> 
					 <h4>Objective:</h4>
A standard cricket match involves two teams, each consisting of 11 players.

				</p>

<p> <h4>Innings:</h4>
Each team has the opportunity to bat and bowl in an inning. In Test matches, each team bats twice.


</p>
<p> <h4>Batting:</h4>

Batsmen score runs by hitting the ball and running between two sets of wickets. A run is completed each time both batsmen successfully reach the opposite ends.

</p>
<p> <h4>Bowling:</h4>

Bowlers aim to dismiss batsmen by getting them out in various ways, such as by bowling the ball to hit the stumps (bowled), catching the ball after the batsman hits it (caught), or trapping the batsman in front of the stumps (LBW - Leg Before Wicket).

</p>
<p> <h4>Wickets:</h4>
The wickets consist of three stumps and two bails. The bowler's objective is to hit the stumps to dismiss a batsman.


</p>
<p> <h4>Dismissals:</h4>
Batsmen can be dismissed in several ways, including being bowled, caught, LBW, run out, stumped, or hit wicket.

</p>
<p> <h4>Boundaries:</h4>
When the ball is hit across the boundary without touching the ground, the batting team scores either four runs (if the ball crosses the boundary after touching the ground) or six runs (if the ball crosses the boundary without touching the ground).


</p>
<p> <h4>Extras:</h4>

Runs can also be scored through extras, which include no-balls, wides, and byes. No-balls and wides result in additional runs, and the batting team does not need to make an effort to score these runs.

</p>
<p> <h4>Overs:</h4>

In limited-overs formats (such as One Day Internationals and Twenty20), each inning is limited to a certain number of overs (usually 50 overs per team in ODIs and 20 overs per team in T20s).

</p>
<p> <h4>Power Plays:</h4>

Limited-overs formats often have power plays, where certain fielding restrictions are in place to encourage aggressive batting.

</p>
<p> <h4>Fielding Positions:</h4>
Fielding teams strategically position players on the field, with common positions like slips, gully, point, cover, mid-off, mid-on, mid-wicket, fine leg, and square leg.

				<h4>Cricket Bat</h4>

Description: The cricket bat is a flat, elongated piece of wood, traditionally made from willow. It has a flat front and a slightly rounded back.</br>
Usage: Batsmen use the cricket bat to hit the ball delivered by the bowler. The primary objective is to score runs by striking the ball and running between the wickets.

				</p>


				<p><h4>Cricket Ball</h4>
Description: The cricket ball is typically made of leather and is red for Test matches and white for limited-overs formats. It has a specific weight and circumference.</br>
Usage: Bowlers aim to dismiss batsmen by delivering the ball in a way that makes it difficult for the batsman to play a shot. They use a combination of pace, spin, and swing to outsmart the batsmen.
